# ResumeTemplate
This is a simple Resume template that uses basic HTML/CSS. The purpose of this small project was to keep repeatedly start over and try a different
way to create the same design. By alternating between flex and grid properties, I was better able to understand the differences between them
and when to apply each one. This process helped me reduce my code by about 200 lines of HTML/CSS.
