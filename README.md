# ResumeTemplate
This is a simple Resume template that uses basic HTML/CSS. The purpose of this small project was to repeatedly start over and try a different approach to create the same design. By alternating between flex and grid properties, I was able to better utilize them on each
iteration.
This process helped me reduce my code by about 200 lines of HTML/CSS.
